## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to construct estimate the equity risk premium for several stocks using a multi factor model and arbitrage pricing theory. The project leverages a simple python script and some raw data collected in excel from Yahoo Finance and other time series sources. The script will output the results of the model into a different excel spreadsheet.

This was an older project of mine. I returned to it in 1/23/2022 to update and clean the repo.
